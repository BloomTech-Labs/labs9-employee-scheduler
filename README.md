## Testing
This library uses Jest for testing. For the server side, we make use of Supertest, and for the client side, we make use of the React-Testing-Library.

Tests can be run in the server by moving into the root, and using `yarn test`. Tests can be run in the client by moving into `/client` and running `yarn test`.
