### Motivation

Cadence is a B2B SaaS created to make shift scheduling quick and painless. Maintaining absolute visibility over your company's schedule can be a difficult task; spreadsheets and legacy software don't do the job. Cadence is an intuitive and easy-to-use application that will do the heavy lifting for you. Just register [here](https://getcadence.co/), create your company, and take our demo for a spin. Drag and drop demo employees to schedule them. Change their availabilities, approve or deny their time off requests, change your business' hours of operations, and much more. When you're done, feel free to remove them and begin adding your own employees. The technical design document / spec for this project is [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-employee-scheduler/blob/master/docs/TDD.md).

### Features

- Secure User Authentication using Google Firebase
- Billing utilizing Stripe payment (including 14-day free trial)
- Drag & Drop Calendar for interactive and intuitive employee shift scheduling
- Create your organization and add employees by inviting them
- Supervisor dashboard to delegate responsibility
- Full visibility and control over your business' hours of operation
- Seamlessly approve, deny and request PTO


### Installation
To install the application in a local dev environment, you can run `yarn local` from the root of the folder. This will install all dependencies and run migrations and seeds for local database.
To install, you will need two environment files:
in the `./` you will need a `.env` file
in the `./client` you will a `.env.development` file

#### To spin up your own .env variables, you will need to do the following:

### Using the App
To start our app locally after completing the above installation, just run `yarn dev`. This will spin up the client on localhost:3000 and the server on localhost:9000. 

### API
Our API is protected by Firebase authentication. A valid JWT must be included on a request header under the 'authorization' key in order for a request to be accepted. In our Redux store, this is `auth.token` for a currently validated user. You can learn more about our API [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-employee-scheduler/blob/master/docs/API.md). You can learn more about our data model [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/labs9-employee-scheduler/blob/master/docs/data_model.md).

### Testing
This library uses Jest for testing. For the server side, we make use of Supertest, and for the client side, we make use of the React-Testing-Library.

Tests can be run in the server by moving into the root, and using `yarn test`. Tests can be run in the client by moving into `/client` and running `yarn test`.
