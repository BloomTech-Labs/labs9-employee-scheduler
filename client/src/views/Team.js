              Kam is a full-stack web developer with a love for all things
              JavaScript: React and Node.js especially! He was previously a loan
              officer and underwriter for SBA loans to small businesses. Today,
              he strives to bring simplicity to the process of building complex
              web applications. Solving problems by thinking them through
              clearly is what makes him happiest, and he strives to help people
              get the information they need and experiences they want. He loves
              working on teams that feel the same way.
