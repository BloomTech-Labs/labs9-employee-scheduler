# Introduction

This document is the first thing you complete as a part of your Lambda Labs project. It will help
you understand your project and plan out a technical design to implement it successfully.
As a team, complete this document and have it approved by the Labs Director or Instructor
before beginning work on the code base.

# Part 1: Understanding Your Project

## Idea

As a developer, you are not directly responsible for the design of your project, but it is very
important that you understand it. The best developers are those that can help the team bridge
the gap between a skeleton outlining an idea, and a real, written, and usable application.
Write three to five sentences explaining each of the following questions: 

**What problem does this application solve?**  
Cadence is an enterprise SaaS application that allows supervisors to schedule their employees’
shifts at work. It enables managers to see their employees’ availability and paid time off at a
glance. It also allows employees to see their own shifts and PTO, as well as to make PTO
requests.  

**Who are your competitors and how do they solve this problem?**  

1. Sling: Sling is a design-led shift scheduling SaaS product priced at $2 / user / month. Its
    core functionality includes shift scheduling, clock-in and -out, and labor costing. Notably,
    it includes social features such as chat, newsfeed, and to-do lists.

2. TSheets: TSheets is built for small to medium business to track scheduling and time on
    the clock. 2-99 users is $4.99 per month with a $16 base fee. 100+ users has a base
    fee of $80 per month. It’s owned by intuit so it integrates with quickbooks.

3. Humanity: Provides easy-to-access employee scheduling app with timeclock, shift
    trading, availability communication, automation, and more. Rated easiest to use by
    Business.com. $3/user/month


4. When I Work: When I Work uses an excel formatted sheet that can add new users as
    employees, schedule their shifts and track over time. It can also forecast your labor costs
    to keep you within your budget. Free up 75 employees, $1.50 (+1.30 per user/per
    month) + 10 day scheduling, schedule multiple teams, remote job sites. $2.25 (+$1.
    additional employees) + Manage Team Tasks Assign Tasks to Employees Monitor Task
    Progress.

5. Shiftboard: Self-description: “Shiftboard transforms complex, hourly workforce
    scheduling processes to help lower labor costs, improve employee retention, & ensure
    workplace compliance.” UI is not featured prominently. Also does timesheet and
    on-boarding. Basic $3/user, Professional $6/user. Seems to be positioning for higher
    level, broader solutions, also scheduling as a strategic decision process.

## User Story

Joel is the supervisor of a small, struggling, locally-owned, boutique cafe. He has 6 employees
who need to know when to show up for work otherwise there will be no one there to man the
store and it will close. That would be sad because he would get fired by the owner. So he needs
to be able to manage his employees.
Luckily, Joel just discovered **Cadence** and behold! It has a schedule where he can
add his employees. It has lots of cool features where the employees can tell him what time they
want off and what their availability is. Joel is elated because now he can use this app to
communicate with his employees about when they can work and when he needs them to work.
With this app, Joel is able to manage his employees shifts and keep the store running at all
times so that it doesn’t close and so that he isn’t sad.

# Part 2: Technology

## Front End

### Solution: React with Redux & React Router  
**What problems does this solution solve for this specific project?**
- React abstracts away browser differences in the DOM, and gains performance benefits via the virtual DOM. It has well known compositional patterns and a strong community, while remaining relatively unopinionated.
- Redux offers a single source of truth via a persistent store, sophisticated built-in debugging, and enforces pre-baked patterns to impose good behavior among developers.
- React Router enables developers to create a single page application. Benefits of SPAs include faster routing between views and smoother transitions & animations. All of this serves to improve user experience.


**What are the costs of using this solution?**
- Use react pattern
- More expensive on the client side, slower initial load for SPAs in particular
- Dependent on third party libraries, and large npm dependency trees. Mitigated by strong
institutional support for React ecosystem, and avoidance of small libraries
- Bad SEO performance
- Will break app if client disallows JS from running  


**What will you be using for styling and presentation?**  
Emotion is a high-performance, lightweight css-in-js library. It aims to minimize the
runtime cost of css-in-js by parsing styles with Babel and PostCSS. It is 25x faster than styled
components when using dynamic props. Kent C. Dodds, the author of glamorous, is considering
deprecating it in favor of emotion.  
As compared to CSS, emotion will enable us to be DRY. Compared to CSS
preprocessing, emotion will enable us to write in a single language. Compared to React
component libraries like Material UI, emotion gives us the flexibility to create our own styling
without succumbing to the demands of opinionated 3rd party software.

## Back End

### Solution: Node & Express  
**What problems does this solution solve for this specific project?:**
- Provides a clean way for us to implement authentication, authorization, and CRUD
actions to our database.
- Node handles asynchronous as a first class citizen, which is well-suited for handling
many requests in a performant way  

**What are the costs of using this solution?**  
- Single threading means we will need to explicitly handle scaling issues
- Modularity of npm and reliance on open source can expose vulnerabilities server side and
requires diligent maintenance

# Database

### Solution: Postgres with Knex  
**What problems does this solution solve for this specific project?**  
- Data persistence (especially with regard to hosting on Heroku, which does not persist
data in SQLite)
- relational data modeling
- SQL-esque API
**What are the costs of using this solution?**  
Implementation and testing will take developer time.  

### Data Model

---
#### Organization  
- id
- name
- description  

---
#### User  
- id
- role (owner, supervisor, employee)
- First name
- Last name
- Password
- email
- phone  

---
#### Availability  
- user
- day
- start time
- end time  

---
#### Time off requests  
- date
- user
- reason
- confirmed/pending/denied  
---
#### Events / Scheduled shifts (including time off)  
- begin time
- end time
- date
- user

# Deployment

### Solution: Netlify & Heroku  
**What problems does this solution solve for this specific project?**
- Enables us to put our project out into the world so that people can use it in an
accessible, reliable way
What are the benefits of using this solution?
- Cost structure is friendly for initial scaling period, with a predictable growth pattern, and
no lock in
- Continuous deployment built in with Github
- Integration testing possible on Heroku via Travis CI
- Heroku has a robust add-ons marketplace
- Heroku provides a dev-friendly layer on top of AWS
What are the costs of using this solution?
- Deployment relies on settings and problem solving specific to each platform, so there is
not a fully contained model that can be painlessly transferred
- Implementation must be friendly to the underlying hardware and operating systems
available from Heroku and Netlify 

# Implementation of Features
---
### ​Landing Page  

**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- local assets
- Emotion 
- styling
- React    

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This is virtually free, as we have already taken on these dependencies. Costs are the need to
implement, but given the customization needed this is equally a feature.    

___
### ​Registration Page / Login Page
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Firebase for Authentication    

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Relying on Google for security, and having a simplified JWT structure that plays nicely with
the front and back end. Rely on openness of Firebase to allow users to authenticate via a
number of options    

---
### ​Schedule Now Button    
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React
- A value in Redux as to whether the user is logged in
- Firebase as described above    

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**
Requires no special functionality, aside from checking that the user is logged in.

**Feature Name: ​ Hours of Operation Modal**  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- reusable modal component
- ping backend through redux to send changes to the database    

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
A reusable modal can be used wherever we need it, and redux will maintain a single source of truth for state management

---
### Left Bar, Top Bar  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React Pose for animation
- Emotion for styling
- Flexbox to lay out elements   

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Animations for the left bar will improve UX for the users, and Pose is a developer-friendly
animation library. Styling will proceed per best practices for navigational elements.    

---
### Calendar Display Presentation and CRUD 
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Display will rely on the React Big Calendar library
-  Backend will be implemented using
database.

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Implementing a calendar has a myriad of specific implementation issues that are not directly
tied to the problem we are trying to solve, so we seek to use prior open source art here. The
downside would be any locked-in formatting that doesn’t meet our design, but if need be we
can fork off what we need from the library and implement our own styles. Given the
widespread use and React pattern, we expect this to be relatively unopinionated in terms of
business logic and to fit well with our data.
Backend will be implemented with our relational database. This allows full expressivity and a
well tested environment and ample resources to support us in implementation. Our spec is
specific enough that a full blown calendar API, like Google Calendar, would likely be overkill
and require significant extra work molding our back end to play nicely with the needs of the
Google Calendar API. We also will avoid lock-in to a third party API that could be changed
without any obligation to us. Once we have handled our own data persistence, a read-only
export to Google Calendar could be considered.  

---
### ​Daily Summary
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React
- Emotion  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
We will display the count of employees working per day and the total count of hours
scheduled. This can potentially be accomplished by array methods such as reduce.  

---
### Employee List  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**    
- React
- Emotion
- Knex  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
We will display a list of employees. For each employee, there is a box showing availability and
a box showing requested time off. We will get this data from the database via SQL query
involving joins with the relevant tables.  

---
### Time Off Dialogues  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Vanilla javascript + React
- Possible but doubtful use of React Portal.  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This is a straightforward prompt for the user to approve and decline time off requested. The
only need is for modal and HTTP post requests, all of which we have with our basic
framework and back end.  

---
### Employee Shift View  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Vanilla javascript + React  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This is the display of data in a structured way, and allowing for ajax requests as needed,
which is directly in the React+Redux core competency. No further API/service is indicated.  

---
### Feature Name:** ​Requested time off  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Reusable react component that maps over data from the backend.  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Reusable and not hard coded.  

---
### Time Off Dialogues  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Vanilla javascript + React
- Possible but doubtful use of React Portal.  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This is a straightforward prompt for the user to approve and decline time off requested. The
only need is for modal and HTTP post requests, all of which we have with our basic
framework and back end.  

---
### ​Add Employee  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React/Redux
- Axios
- Express backend  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This is essentially an input form that makes a POST request on submit. This is provided by
the core choices in our stack and further services would likely result in equal to worse
implementation while increasing package size and muddying structure.  

---
### Input Email / Phone  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React/Redux
- Axios
- Express backend  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**
This is essentially an input form that makes a PUT request on submit, allowing the user to
update their phone number and email. This is provided by the core choices in our stack and
further services would likely result in equal to worse implementation while increasing package
size and muddying structure.  

---
### Select Emails / Text Preference  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React/Redux
- Axios
- Express backend  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**
This uses tools already provided by React / Redux and Express. Axios will be used to lower
surface area of ajax calls and provide error handling support.
A potential stretch related to this feature would use Nodemailer for emailing functionality. This
is not trivial to implement, so a well proven library would be desirable. However, this is not
indicated in the spec and at this point is not considered a MVP feature.  

---
### ​Edit Password  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React/Redux
- Axios
- Express backend
- Potentially Firebase  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This uses tools already provided by React / Redux and Express. Axios will be used to lower
surface area of ajax calls and provide error handling support.
Given that we are using Firebase, we will need to consider whether it is even possible to
straightforwardly trigger password updates within our site.  

---
### ​Time off request  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React reusable component that uses Axios to make a post request to the DB.  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
​Reusable and not hard coded  

---
### ​Time Off Approval  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- This will GET a given user’s PTO from the database and display it  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
This relies on the core components of our tech stack.  

---
### ​Pricing Confirmation /​ ​Payment Form / Checkbox for Recurring Payment  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Stripe API  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Allows us to take payments from users with a widely used API  

---
### ​Availability window  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- Reusable react component taking data from the backend  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Reusable and not hard coded  

---
### ​Employee Shift View  
**What services, APIs, or platforms will you use to implement this feature?**  
- React component
- Redux state management
- Querying data from Node API  

**What are the costs and benefits of using this solution?**  
Completely customizable, integrates well with rest of codebase, but needs to be developed
and tested, which takes time.
